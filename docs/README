DESCRIPTION:
-----------

The software has 2 parts:

1. Corpus Indexer

	It can be used to index any corpus provided all its text (and only text) files are present inside a single folder (the folder structure may be nested).

2. POS Tagger
	This part can be used to tag each word of a given piece of text with its most likely Part of Speech given the HMM data and the ta gset to be used for tagging.

3. KeyWord Extractor
	This part takes a POS Tagged piece of text and generates the keywords that describe the entire text.


HOW TO RUN:
-----------

A. Corpus Indexer
-----------------

1. create a folder "hmm_data" (defined as MACRO in the program) in the directory of the program; the HMM data files will be made/overwritten inside that folder only
2. Place the corpus folder containing the corpus files anywhere on your system; the folder may have a nested structure
3. Run the following command in the folder of the program:

	sh frun.sh <complete path to the folder which contains the corpus files> <target folder for storing the stat files>(OPTIONAL)
	
Now, you will find 3 files in your hmm_data_oanc folder
1. tags_count : 
	first line stores the total number of tags or total number of words in the corpus
	following lines contain the count of each of the 35 tags of the Penn Treebank Tag-Set used in the Brown corpus
2. trans_count:
	contains number of transitions for each pair of tags (total 35 *35 = 1225 pairs)
3. corpFreqData.freq
	contains emmission count of the all the words appearing in the corpus for all the tags/states they appear in
	
****NOTE THAT THE ABOVE FILES CONTAIN 'COUNTS' AND NOT 'PROBABILITIES'

B. POS Tagger
-------------

1. store the given text in a file named 'sample_text' or change the name of the file in prun.sh accordingly
2. to recompile and run:
	
	sh prun.sh > tagger_run_data

A lot of data generated for the purpose of analysis will be directed to the file tagger_generated_data. The Tagged Text will be directed to the terminal screen.

C. KEYWORD EXTRACTOR
--------------------

1. preparing input : 
	a) make a file named input (or change the name accordingly in trun.sh).
	b) Write the total number of words in the first line.
	c) In the second line, write the pos tagged input; the separator of the actual word and POS Tag being an underscore (_) (or change the MACRO 'TAG_SEPARATOR' in the file vertex.h)
	
	NOTE : The POS Tagger above writes such an output on the standard error stream.

2. To recompile and run the KeyWord Extractor, use the following command:
	
	sh trun.sh
	

****THE MAKEFILE PROVIDED HAS VARIOUS USEFUL TARGETS:
-----------------------------------------------------

1. freq_gen_clean : removes all object files of the corpus indexer
2. freq_gen_install : compiles the corpus indexer
3. pos_tagger_clean : removes all the object files of the tagger
4. pos_tagger_install : recompiles the tagger
5. txsm_clean : removes all the object files of the KeyWord Extractor
6. txsm_install : recompiles the KeyWord Extractor
